### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer consultant at [Consid](https://consid.se/en/) with project experience in government, telecom and financing. 

A couple of years ago I got interested in building my first CNC machine and has since then kept tinkering and are now an active contributor to [Universal G-code Sender](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender)


If you appreciate the work I am doing consider sponsoring me!
